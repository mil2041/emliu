# About

I am currently a postdoctoral associate at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
I graduated from Weill Cornell Medicine with a PhD in Physiology, Biophysics and Systems Biology in 2019 under the supervision of [Dr. Ekta Khurana](https://khuranalab.med.cornell.edu/). My research focuses on applying statistcal analysis and machine learning to large-scale multi-omics data in human cancers.
