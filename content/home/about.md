# About

I am currently a postdoctoral associate at Weill Cornell Medicine.
I graduated from Weill Cornell Medicine with a PhD in Physiology, Biophysics and Systems Biology in 2019, advised
from Professor Ekta Khurana. My research focuses on applying statistcal analysis, machine learning methods to 
large-scale multi-omics data in human cancers.
