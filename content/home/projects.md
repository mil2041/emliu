#### Non-coding cancer driver web app

* Design a relational database system that stores the non-coding cancer evidences curated from literature.     
* Develop a front-end web application that provides summary statistics and novel data representation of non-coding cancer evidences across 28 cancer types.

#### Cancer driver detection

* Develop a new statistical inference method to discover coding and non-coding cancer drivers from 1962 whole -genome sequencing tumor samples. The package uses parallel programming to reduce the run time by 80%.      
* Integrate multi-omics datasets from WGS, WXS, 1000 genome, ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, ChIP-seq, Hi-C and ChIA-PET.

#### Integrated pathway analysis

* Implement “NetBox” algorithm and prepare technical documentations to facilitate pathway analysis. 
* Contribute the integrated pathway analysis in three TCGA publications including sarcoma, mesothelioma, and testicular germ cell tumors under the supervision of Professor Chris Sander.
