For inspiration, refer to the Markdown content which powers the Demo  Install with Git Prerequisites:\n Download and install Git Download and install Hugo   Fork the Academic Kickstart repository and clone your fork with Git:\ngit clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git My_Website  Note that if you forked Academic Kickstart, the above command should be edited to clone your fork, i.e. replace sourcethemes with your GitHub username.\n Initialize the theme:\ncd My_Website git submodule update --init --recursive   Install with ZIP  Download and extract Academic Kickstart Download and extract the Academic theme to the themes/academic/ folder from the above step  Install with RStudio View the guide to installing Academic with RStudio\nQuick start  If you installed on your computer, view your new website by running the following command:\nhugo server  Now visit localhost:1313 and your new Academic powered website will appear. Otherwise, if using Netlify, they will provide you with your URL.\n Read the Quick Start Guide to learn how to add Markdown content, customize your site, and deploy it. For inspiration, refer to the Markdown content which powers the Demo\n Build your site by running the hugo command. Then host it for free using Github Pages or Netlify (refer to the first installation method). Alternatively, copy the generated public/ directory (by FTP, Rsync, etc.) to your production web server (such as a university\u0026rsquo;s hosting service).\n  Updating Feel free to star the project on Github to help keep track of updates and check out the release notes prior to updating your site.\nBefore updating the framework, it is recommended to make a backup of your entire website directory (or at least your themes/academic directory) and record your current version number.\nBy default, Academic is installed as a Git submodule which can be updated by running the following command:\ngit submodule update --remote --merge  Check out the update guide for full instructions and alternative methods.\nFeedback \u0026amp; Contributing Please use the issue tracker to let me know about any bugs or feature requests, or alternatively make a pull request.\nFor support, head over to the Hugo discussion forum.\nLicense Copyright 2016-present George Cushen.\nReleased under the MIT license.\n","date":1461124800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515819600,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Create a beautifully simple website or blog in under 10 minutes.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Academic: the website designer for Hugo","type":"post"},{"authors":["GA Cushen"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1441080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441080000,"objectID":"55712140ff26d3a320f6059d97d765fb","permalink":"/tmp/person-re-identification/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/tmp/person-re-identification/","section":"tmp","summary":"Person re-identification is a critical security task for recognizing a person across spatially disjoint sensors. Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"tmp"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications.
